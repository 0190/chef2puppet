Chef2Puppet
===========

This is the beginnings of a mechanism for converting Chef cookbooks to Puppet classes and modules.
It is intended to work with Chef recipes built largely using the DSL without resorting much to
other Ruby code.  It is in the mid-stages now and simply generates Puppet classes with mostly
correct syntax.  You will definitely need to hand edit the resulting Puppet code.
